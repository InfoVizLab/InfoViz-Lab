                <b>A study on the Visualization Characteristics ‘Warning Pictogram’ for climate disaster guidance</b>
                <p>The weather and climate have a significant impact on both humanity and the ecosystem. Extreme weather events, such as floods, storms, and heat waves, are becoming more frequent. In this study, warning pictograms for natural disasters like typhoons, floods, heat waves, and cold waves were collected and analyzed from the official systems in Hong Kong, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Each pictogram was evaluated based on signal system, color, symbol type, and language. The study found that climate disaster warning pictograms, as part of national disaster safety systems, serve as symbolic languages that can influence citizens' decision-making during emergencies caused by severe weather. A well-designed warning pictogram system can enhance social responsiveness to climate disasters. This research aims to provide foundational data for designing pictograms to help minimize the damage from future climate disasters in Korea.</p>
