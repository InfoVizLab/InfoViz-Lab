                <b>Abstract</b>
                <p>In the era of the pandemic, the importance of disease data visualization has been underscored. This study critically examines the design of disease data dashboards, specifically focusing on those utilized by the infectious disease management support teams. These dashboards, primarily intended for professional use, employ detailed charts to represent extensive data sets. Our analysis reveals that while there has been a concerted effort to customize visualizations to fit region-specific data, significant enhancements from a usability perspective are required. Consequently, we argue that infectious disease dashboards should progress towards accommodating personalized and public health needs, taking into account the divergent requirements across user types. In this transformation, the synergistic collaboration of UX/UI designers and data visualization experts is deemed indispensable, with the ultimate aim to construct a system capable of providing macroscopic insights into infection statuses. This study hence contributes to the ongoing discourse by proposing vital elements for the improvement of infectious disease dashboards, anticipating its findings to serve as a valuable resource in the effective construction of future dashboards.</p>
