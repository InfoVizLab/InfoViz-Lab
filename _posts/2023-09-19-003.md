Dashboards offer a curated lens through which people can view large and complex data sets at a glance. They combine visual representations and other graphical embellishments to provide layers of abstraction and simplification for numerous related data points, so that viewers get an overview of the most important or relevant information, in a time-efficient way. Their ability to provide insight at a glance has led to dashboards being widely used across many application domains, such as business, nursing and hospitals, public health, learning analytics, urban analytics, personal analytics, energy, and public communication.
